  <p class="p-statement">
    I had been inclined to explore art before and it had become one of my favorite things to do with my leisure time.<br>
    I enjoy doing it and it evolved as a hobby and a way of venting what's on my heart and mind.

      Albert is an outstanding fine arts student from UP Diliman and has a very rough, sketchy, and natural art style. He explores different mediums and I was inspired to do the same.  I look up to him since he can maintain his art styles and expression even with different mediums and honestly, I want to put stress on how hard it is. Even if he's still a student, I see him as an established model ever since. He also has other hobbies such as playing the piano keyboard and doing other art-related matters such as photography, videography, and editing which also are the things that I would like to explore and have a skill to. His humor and fashion sense also influenced mine and it's one of the things that I value since even if I'm just modeling someone, it brought me a realization that having your own established and distinct identity in various aspects is an art in its own form. It is beautiful and inspiring and that motivated me to do so - looking for who I really am and will also try to inspire other people.

      I miss my old self that's why I chose a subject that has been an inspiration ever since. It gives me nostalgia every time I see Albert and his artwork on my Instagram feed. Now I've been given a chance to look back and practice doing art again with this piece, the thought processes and actual preparation before coming up with it brought me back to those times when I was still motivated and inspired to pursue an art degree and have a career in this field.

  <p class="p-statement">
    I know passion never fades inside and I deeply feel I still have it. It's just a matter of practicality and personal desires that I now weigh in life. I will forever cherish those times and quality of mine and will not get tired of looking back. To my free-spirited self, I know we will meet soon. We will hold those pencils and brushes once again and create more memories of the things we truly enjoy and admire. With Albert being an inspiration to me, him being the subject of an art piece would reflect this story of mine and serve as a representation of a part of who I truly am behind these computer screens.
